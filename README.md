# btsoccer
A 3d multiplatform Button Soccer game.

BtSoccer is a 3d multiplatform button soccer game, mainly focused for multitouch
devices play (although workable with a mouse). The game features multiplayer
support (both at the same device or online), dozens of teams, with two uniforms
each and three field sizes to play. It currently misses the implementation of a
proper AI, thus single player play (and also championships) are currently
broken or on-development.
